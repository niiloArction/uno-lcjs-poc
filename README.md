Repository forked from https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Samples.

Idea of LCJS x Uno (including WASM) support something like this:

![LCJS Board (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55391673/222373677-1692c91d-84a3-4a0d-af86-b3793613583e.jpg)

This PoC is currently unrealized. The next part would be making some basic HTML/JS LCJS application and managing to load it inside iframe in Uno WASM application and display it in the UI.

Afterwards: investigate data transferring from C# application to JS application using SignalR or something similar.
